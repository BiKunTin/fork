Creating a *fork* is producing a personal copy of someone else’s project. Forks act as a sort of bridge between the original repository and your personal copy. You can submit PRs (*Pull Requests*) to help make other people’s projects better by offering your changes up to the original project. Forking is at the core of social coding at GitHub.

After forking this repository, please add a file yourFirstnameLastname.txt (e.g. JohnDoe.txt) to your project, and submit a Pull Request to the upstream project (this repository).

For some more information on how to fork a repository, [check out GitHub's guide, "Forking Projects""](http://guides.github.com/overviews/forking/). Go Grogs! :purple_heart:
